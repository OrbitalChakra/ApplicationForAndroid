# ApplicationForAndroid
The goal of this application was to develop an event notificaiton application. I needed to add a login screen and a screen where users could edit the events in their queue
by adding or removing events. I used requirements gathering and analysis before working on the devlopment implementation, using a waterfall method. I used end to end testing to test the app. 
I was succesful at building queries and views for the applicaiton. The views used a different approach than that that I had planned on.
